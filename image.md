# What is Domain and Range of an image

For an image, 
the domain is the set of all possible pixel locations.
the range corresponds to all possible intensity values.

# Image transformations: [T]

## Filtering
is changing the range of image: g(x) = T(f(x))

## Warping
is changing the domain of image: g(x) = f(T(x))
